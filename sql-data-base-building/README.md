The goal of this project is to build your own database from several csv files. 

I created this project to practice mySQL and to learn how to use it. 

The project is divided in three parts in order to build the ideal videoclub database. 

# part 1:

witch includes:
business logic and data-base structure
with client-store-staff-rental-return..etc.

# part 2:
product data-base to store the products and their characteristics.
in this case, films and their characteristics.

# part 3:
the vinculations between the two structures.
this information will be stored in the info_category table.
